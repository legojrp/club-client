# Verify Component

The `Verify` component provides a user interface for sending a password reset link to the user's email address. It handles the process of entering an email, validating it, sending the request to the backend, and displaying appropriate feedback based on the result.

## Import Statements

```javascript
import React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react';
import { UserOutlined, CloseOutlined, CheckCircleTwoTone, LoadingOutlined, CloseCircleTwoTone } from '@ant-design/icons';
import { Link } from 'react-router-dom';
import { Card, Typography, Input, Button } from 'antd';
import logo from '../img/hsekey.png';
import axios from 'axios';
const { Title, Text } = Typography;
```

### Dependencies

- **React**: The base library for building the user interface.
- **React Router DOM**: For managing navigation and linking between pages.
- **Ant Design (antd)**: A React UI library for styling and components.
- **axios**: For making HTTP requests to the backend.

## Component State

- **loading**: Boolean state indicating whether the password reset request is in progress.
- **sent**: Boolean state indicating whether the reset email has been successfully sent.
- **error**: Boolean state indicating whether there was an error in the process.
- **errors**: Array to store any validation errors.
- **formData**: Object storing the user's email input.

## Component Structure

### Layout

- The component is centered on the page using a flexbox layout.
- The `Card` component from Ant Design wraps the content to give it a neat and organized appearance.

### Title and Logo

- **Title**: Displays "Forgot Password" at the top of the card.
- **Logo**: A small logo image is displayed next to the title.

### Input Field

- **Email**: An input field is provided to capture the user’s email address.

### Error Handling

- **Validation Errors**: Basic validation ensures that the email field is not empty before submitting the form. Errors are displayed directly beneath the input field.
- **Server Errors**: If the reset request fails, an error message is displayed.

### Button

- **Send Password Reset**: A primary button triggers the process of sending the password reset email. It shows a loading spinner when the request is in progress.

### Feedback Messages

- **Success Message**: If the email is sent successfully, a success icon and message are displayed.
- **Error Message**: If the email sending fails, an error icon and message are displayed.

### Link

- **Back to Home**: A link to navigate back to the home page is provided after the email has been sent or if an error occurs.

## Functions

### useEffect Hook

- **Purpose**: Sets the document title to "HSE Key | Signup" when the component is mounted.

### handleForm(e)

- **Purpose**: Updates the `formData` state whenever a user types into the email input field.

### sendEmail()

- **Purpose**: Validates the email field, sends a PUT request to the backend to initiate the password reset process, and handles the response.
- **Validation**: Ensures the email field is not empty before submitting.
- **API Request**: Sends the email to the backend API. If successful, it updates the `sent` state to true. Otherwise, it sets the `error` state to true and displays an error message.

## Conditional Rendering

- The component conditionally renders different sections based on the state:
  - **Initial State**: Displays the email input field and submit button.
  - **Loading State**: Displays a loading spinner when the request is in progress.
  - **Success State**: Displays a success message and icon if the email is successfully sent.
  - **Error State**: Displays an error message and icon if there is a server-side error.

## Example Usage

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import { BrowserRouter as Router, Route } from 'react-router-dom';
import Verify from './components/Verify';

const App = () => (
  <Router>
    <Route path="/verify" component={Verify} />
  </Router>
);

export default App;
```

## Additional Notes

- **Responsiveness**: The layout is designed to be centered and responsive across different screen sizes.
- **User Experience**: The component provides immediate feedback to the user about the success or failure of their password reset attempt.
- **Error Display**: Errors are displayed dynamically and cleared automatically after 2.5 seconds.
- **Navigation**: After the reset link is sent or an error occurs, the user can navigate back to the home page via a provided link.
