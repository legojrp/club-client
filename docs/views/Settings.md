## Component Structure

### Navbar

- The `Navbar` component is included at the top of the settings page for consistent navigation across the app.

### Page Layout

- **`Row` and `Col`:** Ant Design grid components are used for layout. The settings page is centered on the screen.

### Page Header

- **`PageHeader`:** Displays the title "Settings" with a back button to return to the previous page.

### Settings Navigation

- **`SettingsNav`:** A custom component for navigating between different settings sections.
  - **`Menu.Item` (info):** Displays "My Account" with a user icon.
  - **`Menu.Item` (logout):** Displays "Logout" with a logout icon and triggers the `logout` function.

### User Information Form

- **AvatarUpload**: Custom component for uploading and displaying the user's avatar.
- **Input Fields**:
  - **Name**: Editable text field for the user's name.
  - **Email**: Non-editable text field for the user's email with a verification status indicator.
  - **Phone**: Editable text field for the user's phone number.
  - **Class**: Editable text field for the user's class, visible only if the userâ€™s role is "teacher".

### Early Adopter Program

- **Switch**: Toggle switch for opting into the early adopter program, allowing users to receive features earlier.

### Save Button

- **Save**: A button that triggers the `updateUser` function to save the user's updated information.

## Functions

### logout()

Logs the user out by clearing the authentication state and redirecting to the home page.

### handleForm(e)

Handles changes in form input fields and updates the form state accordingly. Sets the `edited` flag to `true` when changes are detected.

### updateUser()

Sends an HTTP PUT request to update the user's information. On success, it updates the authentication state with the new user data and displays a success message. On failure, it displays error messages.

### useEffect Hook

Monitors changes in the `auth` state and initializes the form data when the component is mounted or when the `auth` state changes.

## Example Usage

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import { BrowserRouter as Router, Route } from 'react-router-dom';
import Settings from './components/Settings';

const App = () => (
  <Router>
    <Route path="/settings" component={Settings} />
  </Router>
);

export default App;
```

## Additional Notes

- **Responsive Design:** The component uses Ant Design's grid system to ensure that the layout is responsive.
- **Error Handling:** The `errors` state and `message` component from Ant Design are used to display errors and success messages to the user.
- **Customization:** The component can be customized by modifying the input fields, layout, or styles.
